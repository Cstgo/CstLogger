The idea is to make a open hardware pollution detection took-kit for citizen-scientists to measure environmental quality, and to also develop a web platform to integrate these measurements into open databases of air, water, and land pollution along Chile and grow a citizen-based network for environmental monitoring. The idea for a proof-of-concept application is to build at least four devices and deploy one on each of four campuses (plus a mobile bike-lab), and gather envrinmental data from these locations in order to map the data on to a web-accesible database and visualization platform.
